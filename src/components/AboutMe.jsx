      <p className='aboutMe'>My name is Temitope Balogun. I am a software engineer student at Perscholas bootcamp. The everchanging Technology has always made me keen on learning more about this exciting field. Ever since I was a kid, I've always been intrigued about how computers work in terms of how users utilize the computer to do things seamlessly. Even though I went on to receive my nursing degree, that burning desire for technology has never gone away. This portfolio showcases some of my work as a software engineer student. .</p>
