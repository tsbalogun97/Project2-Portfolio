<h1 align="center">My Portfolio</h1>
As I reflect upon graduating from Perscholas Software engineering Bootcamp, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. My journey through this rigorous bootcamp has not been without trials and tribulations. However, I feel that my growth as an individual and student is a direct result of these experiences. The entries I have chosen to include in my portfolio not only demonstrates how much work I've put in over the course of the training, but also how much I’ve fine-tuned my skills-set in programming.

<h3>CREDITS</h3>
This is a link to a website that inspires me to make this game https://thedartsgame.sourceforge.net/ 


I also took some element from the game, [Mortal Kombat 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBGpEXbPhms)

In addition, I also added a snippet of well known music from the popular game, [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsa_4s3CjmI) in order to add some flair to the game

<h3>MY JOURNEY</h3>
I really enjoyed making this game. It was very difficult because I was hit with many challenges along the way. Through it all, I am happy to see the vision of making this game comes to fruition.
