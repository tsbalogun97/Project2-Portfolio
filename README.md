<u><h1 align="center">My Portfolio</h1></u>
As I reflect upon graduating from Perscholas Software engineering Bootcamp, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. My journey through this rigorous bootcamp has not been without trials and tribulations. However, I feel that my growth as an individual and student is a direct result of these experiences. The entries I have chosen to include in my portfolio not only demonstrates how much work I've put in over the course of the training, but also how much I’ve fine-tuned my skills-set in programming.

<h3>BUILT WITH</h3>
<p>React libraries using:</p>
<li>Html</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>

<hr>

<h3>THE APPROACH TAKEN</h3>
I wanted to build an App that is simple and user-friendly. I also wanted my page to not only talk about me but also include inspirational quotes for my users to read. 

<hr>


<h3>FUTURE UPDATES</h3>
My portfolio is still developing; meaning more robust features will be added:
<li>I will add more background keyframes to the pages especially in the main page.</li> 
<li>I will add perhaps an audio playing in the background.</li>

<h3>CREDITS</h3>
This is a link to a website that inspired me to  add Marquee tag to my technology page  https://reactjsexample.com/a-silky-smooth-marquee-with-react/ 


This website helped how to utilize Marquee tag in my Porfolio https://way2tutorial.com/html/html_marquee_image.php/

<h3>MY STRUGGLES</h3>
<li>I struggled alot with typos which meant errors popping up on my page and having to pinpoint exactly where was hell.</li>
<li>I also had an issue with my resume popping up on my resume page. For some reasons, it didn't work, only to realize that i  didn't import it in the app.js.</li>
<li>I also had issues converting my React app to a live webpage for anyone to connect to.</li>
<li> It took me hours to figure out what was wrong with my code when i was trying to upload my git Api to display my top 3 projects.</li>

<h1 align="center">Installation Instructions</h1>
In the project directory, you can run:

<h3>npm start</h3>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<h3>npm test</h3>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

<h3>npm run build</h3>
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

<h3>npm run eject</h3>
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
