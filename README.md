<u><h1 align="center">My Portfolio</h1></u>
As I reflect upon graduating from Perscholas Software engineering Bootcamp, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. My journey through this rigorous bootcamp has not been without trials and tribulations. However, I feel that my growth as an individual and student is a direct result of these experiences. The entries I have chosen to include in my portfolio not only demonstrates how much work I've put in over the course of the training, but also how much I’ve fine-tuned my skills-set in programming.

<h3>BUILT WITH</h3>
<p>React libraries using:</p>
<li>Html</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>

<hr>

<h3>THE APPROACH TAKEN</h3>
I wanted to build an App that is simple and user-friendly. I also wanted my page to not only talk about me but also include inspirational quotes for my users to read. 

<hr>


<h3>FUTURE UPDATES</h3>
My portfolio is still developing; meaning more robust features will be added:
<li>I will add more background keyframes to the pages especially in the main page.</li> 
<li>I will add perhaps an audio playing in the background.</li>

<h3>MY STRUGGLES</h3>
<li>I struggled alot with typos which meant errors popping up on my page and having to pinpoint exactly where was hell.</li>
<li>I also had an issue with my resume popping up on my resume page. For some reasons, it didn't work, only to realize that i  didn't import it in the app.js.</li>
<li>I also had issues converting my React app to a live webpage for anyone to connect to.</li>
<li> It took me hours to figure out what was wrong with my code when i was trying to upload my git Api to display my top 3 projects.</li>
